CALIX ADDONS

The Calix Addons project is a side project of mine, sort
of like a spiritual successor or continuation of my pre-
vious GlasshouseTweaks Spigot mod. It's designed as, es-
sentially, a 'lax way to keep track of who is killing w-
ho.

The name Calix came from a school project I've worked on
before. I didn't want to use GlasshouseTweaks again, as
'The Glasshouse' no longer exists.

It's licensed under GPU GPL v3. Copy/redistribution is 
welcome and encouraged, but any use of any code must be 
made free and open source software. Thanks.
